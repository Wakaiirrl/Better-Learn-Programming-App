      topicTitle: 'OOP in Python',
      topicDescription:
          '''Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.

One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:

attributes
behavior
Let's take an example:

A parrot is an object, as it has the following properties:

name, age, color as attributes
singing, dancing as behavior
The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).''',
      sampleProgram: '''#!/usr/bin/python

class Employee:
   'Common base class for all employees'
   empCount = 0

   def init(self, name, salary):
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1

   def displayCount(self):
     print "Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount

   def displayEmployee(self):
      print "Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary

"This would create first object of Employee class"
emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
"This would create second object of Employee class"

      programDescription: ''' the above program, we defined a Computer class.

We used init() method to store the maximum selling price of Computer. We tried to modify the price. However, we can't change it because Python treats the __maxprice as private attributes.

As shown, to change the value, we have to use a setter function i.e setMaxPrice() which takes price as a parameter.'''),

Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types).
