From Wikipedia,
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F0 = 0,   F1 = 1,

and

Fn = Fn - 1 + Fn - 2,

for n > 1.

The beginning of the sequence is thus:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,....''',
