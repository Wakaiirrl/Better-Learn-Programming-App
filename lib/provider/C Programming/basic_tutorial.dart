💠 The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.

💠 The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.

💠 The next line '// main() is where program execution begins.' is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.

💠 The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.

💠 The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.

💠 The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.'''),
