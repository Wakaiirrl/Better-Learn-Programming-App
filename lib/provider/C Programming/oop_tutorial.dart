💠 Object
💠 Class
💠 Inheritance
💠 Polymorphism
💠 Abstraction
💠 Encapsulation

💠 Object
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.

💠 Class
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

💠 Inheritance
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

💠 Polymorphism
When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.

In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.

💠 Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

💠 Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.''',

OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.
OOPs provide data hiding whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language a global data can be accessed from anywhere.
OOPs provide ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.'''),

C++ supports five types of inheritance:

Single inheritance
Multiple inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance
Multilevel inheritance
Hybrid inheritance
Derived Classes
A Derived class is defined as the class derived from the base class.

      topicTitle: '''Data Encapsulation in C++''',
      topicDescription:
          '''All C++ programs are composed of the following two fundamental elements −

Program statements (code) − This is the part of a program that performs actions and they are called functions.

Program data − The data is the information of the program which gets affected by the program functions.

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.

Data encapsulation is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and data abstraction is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.
C++ supports the properties of encapsulation and data hiding through the creation of user-defined types, called classes. We already have studied that a class can contain private, protected and public members. By default, all items defined in a class are private. The variables length, breadth, and height are private. This means that they can be accessed only by other members of the Box class, and not by any other part of your program. This is one way encapsulation is achieved.

To make parts of a class public (i.e., accessible to other parts of your program), you must declare them after the public keyword. All variables or functions defined after the public specifier are accessible by all other functions in your program.

Making one class a friend of another exposes the implementation details and reduces encapsulation. The ideal is to keep as many of the details of each class hidden from all other classes as possible.
Data Encapsulation Example
Any C++ program where you implement a class with public and private members is an example of data encapsulation and data abstraction. Consider the following example −''',
